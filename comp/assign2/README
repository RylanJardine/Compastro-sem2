This code solves the equations of motion for a simple test system in an orbital plane
with acceleration in x and y of a=-GMx/r^3. This is done using either a simple
leapfrog integrator or a fourth order Runge Kutta method for a total of 5000 timesteps.
The number of timesteps can be changed in the assign2.f90 file.  The size of the
timestep, routine and the eccentricity of the orbit are all enetered by the user
into the terminal when prompted, 1 file is output at the final timestep.
