This program is designed to calculate the density, pressure, position, velocity,
sound speed, acceleration, internal energy and more parameters for 2 different
types of problem. 1 is a standing wave, and the other is a shock tube which
can be selected in 2 types either as an isothermal shock tube or one with an
adiabatic EOS with a certain gamma value. The code outputs snap files for
specific timesteps (there is not an output for every timestep) and these files
can be plotted using splash. There is also an output 'kin.dat' which stores
conservation of mass, momentum and the total kinetic energy.

The code itself can be compiled by using the makefile and typing 'make'.
It can then be executed using the command ./solve from there the code prompts
you to ask which problem you would like to solve (1) standing wave (2) Isothermal
shock tube (3) adiabatic shock tube. Then you are also prompted to select the
viscosity parameters and if you'd like a variable smoothing length. Other parameters
such as the grid size/setup can be altered in the file param.f90 which stores the
global list of parameters.
